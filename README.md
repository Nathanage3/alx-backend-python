# Advanced Python & Software Engineering Portfolio

**Note to Employers & Recruiters**

This repository is a focused portfolio demonstrating mastery of modern Python's most powerful features. Each project directory showcases a core concept essential for building robust, high-performance, and maintainable applications:

Static Type Hinting (for reliable code)

Asynchronous Programming (for high-concurrency)

Software Testing (for robust development)

These projects reflect a deep understanding of Python internals and best practices.

# üöÄ Project Showcase

**Project Directory***&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**Concept / Skill Demonstrated**&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; **Key Technologies**

1. **0x00-python_variable_annotations** &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Python Type Annotations&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Python 3.7+, Typing module

<br />

This project demonstrates a deep understanding of Python's type hinting system (PEP 484). It covers annotating variables, function parameters, and return values to write cleaner, more robust, and self-documenting code.

<br />

2. **0x01-python_async_function** &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Asynchronous Programming&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Python, asyncio, async/await
<br />

This project explores the fundamentals of asynchronous programming in Python. It includes writing coroutines with async/await, creating concurrent asyncio.Task instances, and managing the async event loop.

<br />

3. **0x02-python_async_comprehension** &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Advanced Async Concepts&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Python, asyncio, Async Comprehensions

<br />

Expands on async programming by using asynchronous comprehensions and generators. This demonstrates how to write highly efficient, non-blocking code for processing streams of data.
<br />

4. **0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests** &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Unit & Integration Testing&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Python, unittest, unittest.mock
<br />
Shows proficiency in writing comprehensive tests for Python code. This includes using the unittest framework, mocking external APIs and dependencies (unittest.mock), and structuring both unit and integration tests.

<br />

**üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Demonstrated**

The projects in this repository collectively showcase my proficiency in:

Advanced Python Programming: Writing robust, modern code using type hinting, async/await, and async comprehensions.

Concurrency & Performance: Building non-blocking applications capable of handling many tasks concurrently using asyncio.

Software Testing & TDD: Writing comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

Code Quality & Maintainability: Creating self-documenting and robust code through the use of static typing.

Mocking & Integration: Isolating code for testing and simulating external dependencies using unittest.mock.

**üì¶ How to Explore**

Each directory is a standalone project. To run any of them:

Clone this repository.

Navigate into a specific project folder (e.g., cd 0x01-python_async_function).

Each project has its own set of dependencies. Please refer to the requirements.txt within each folder (if applicable).

(Developer Note: I highly recommend adding a simple README.md inside each project folder with specific 1-2-3 steps on how to install and run that project. This shows professionalism!)
